                        <p>The name of haleiwa comes from two words hale which is home and iwa which is a bird, this leads to the name of house of the frigate bird. Haleiwa then and still now is a surf town. The haleiwa hotel was a landmark that brought many. During the 1950s is when the north shore side started to become more of a surfing place… Known for its great beaches and big wave surfing, this social and artistic hub of the North Shore is a favorite refuge for Hawaii residents and a must-see for visitors. It is a place for surfers, beach goers, fishing enthusiasts, craftspeople, and artists. The name was permanently established in the area by the Haleiwa Hotel. Benjamin Dillingham opened the Haleiwa Hotel on the North Shore area back in 1898. When the hotel opened, the name was translated as “beautiful home.” The hotel was a popular beach resort destination on the Oahu Railway and Land Company train line from 1899 to 1943.</p>

                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>In the beginning Waimalu was a place that was mainly marshes. It is said that it was first occupied in the 500 AD. Even though there was a good amount of rain the land was not cultivated, chich leads to no agriculture. At old times, people used to make their living by fishing which brought a major income to the district. During the ancient times Waimalu was the capital of the area where kings lived. Waimalu was also a commercial district so it had a good influence on trade for hawaii. They used to fish and played on the slopes that surround the marshes. It is reported that the marshes were inhabited and first occupied about five hundred AD. Because of the wetlands it was not possible to cultivate and therefore there was no agriculture in spite of the abundance of rain in the area. In early days the Hawaiians used to live beside the lagoon that was built hundreds of meters from the shoreline. Waimalu was thickly populated in ancient times and was the capital of the area where kings used to live. In 1940 the population of Waimalu was decreased to a small number of three thousand. After the world war two a lot of portions of land had been bought by the government to expand its military bases. Also after the second world war the first European contact with the land was after 1889 during European settlers came into the land and inhabited making the place a place of culture. In twentieth century Waimalu was an independent state that was recognized by Hawaii but because of different changes in Waimalu’s place over time, it had to be derecognized. In old times people used to make their living by fishing which brought a major income to the district. The average family in Waimalu was very prosperous until the Second World War. Waimalu is also a commercial district with great activities in trade, industry and education. The progress in the sugar industry was brought to and end. Before it was an agriculture land but it has been brought back and the land is now able to sustain vegetation. Waimalu want to stay away from the crowds and the noise which is the standard feature of a big city. Instead, what the locals who live here want is peace and quiet so that they can relax. This area is nothing short of a part of heaven. Waimalu was inhabited with Hawaiian families almost 15000 years ago and are believe to be one of the early settlers in the world today. </p>

These fish ponds have a very big cultural significance to the Hawaiian People. In 1965 the fish ponds were destroyed due to a flood but Mary Brooks was able to revive it using a mixture of the hawaiian and western Techniques……..Water from Ha’iku and ‘Ioleka’s Valleys created a marshland called Hoi where kalo was grown. Kalo was then replaced by sugarcanes, pineapples and rice and then cattle. But by the brought of these other things made the land degrade the health of its vegetations. Then came Mangroves which stopped it from happening. Heeia now have its great coral reef and view of the islands mountains. Also in this places past, in 1878 a sugar mill was built. In 1883 a railroad was built because it was too far for people to be transporting goods across Heeia and far away place. But then they had to shut down its sugar mill business, which consisted of making, sugar, taro, rice etc. As time passes, George W. Roman built a cattle ranch and bought 1,000 acres of land for agriculture such as growing pineapples. Things changed when the US came to the land, which made Heeia a combat training area. In 1949, the City and County of Honolulu agreed to changed Heeia from an agriculture land to urban and residential areas.</p>

                        <p> The name Aiea came from a small Hawaiian bush that was once used to bind pili together. Hawaiian Plantation Company made some sugar plantation in Aiea during 1898. In 1898, a railroad was put together that instigated the birth of Aiea. The town later developed when the majority of  sugar plantations were terminated after World War 2. Aiea sugar business finally came to an end in 1996…….. Ancient Hawaiians once harvested Loi, fished and lived in grass huts in Aiea. Aiea is describe as belonging to many different people, and its land was filled with taro and banana plantations. Aiea came late to Sugar Plantations businesses. In 1899, Aiea came late to the sugar business. So then it became the ‘Honolulu Plantation Company’. 23,000 acres of land have been granted all over and around Aiea. Plantation operations ended after the company lost a significant portion of their sugar cane fields to military operations, roads, and commercial and housing developments.</p>

During the 1950s is when the north shore side started to become more of a surfing place… Known for its great beaches and big wave surfing, this social and artistic hub of the North Shore is a favorite refuge for Hawaii residents and a must-see for visitors. It is a place for surfers, beach goers, fishing enthusiasts, craftspeople, and artists. The name was permanently established in the area by the Haleiwa Hotel. Benjamin Dillingham opened the Haleiwa Hotel on the North Shore area back in 1898. When the hotel opened, the name was translated as “beautiful home.” The hotel was a popular beach resort destination on the Oahu Railway and Land Company train line from 1899 to 1943.  Hale'iwa was designated a State Historic, Cultural and Scenic District in 1984 by the City and County of Honolulu. All new buildings must adhere to a design plan that reflects the territorial architecture of Hale’iwa’s earlier sugar industry period. The town is home to 30 historic buildings featuring plantation architectural styles influenced by the Waialua Sugar Co.

                        <p>It’s a small town and valley on Oahu's west shore. It is the first town as you drive up Oahu's leeward coast. “Nanakuli”, the first town you encounter as you drive along the island of Oahu’s leeward coast. Nanakuli supposedly means “Look at knee”, or “knee inspection”. But there’s been ideas that the meaning of Nanakuli is actually “pretend to be deaf” in the Hawaiian language. This idea is based on an old story told about this town’s past. In Hawaii, whenever there’s travelers, they would offer them food. But since the leeward coast has a hot and dry climate, the people living in this area back then were not successful in growing much food at all here. So, to avoid this shame, they would pretend to be deaf. Which means that they would ignore them or hide from them too. Nanakuli has a nice beach, known as Nanakuli Beach Park. The waves and currents are strong in the winter months, but in the summer it's usually calm and a favorite gathering spot among local residents.</p>

                        <p>In the year of 1855 Makaha was bought by the james robinson firm. Makaha valley became a ranch, this ranch had animals and crops grown on it. During WWII there was ammunition stored within makaha. During the 1960s Makaha Shores, Makaha Valley Towers, Makaha Beach Cabanas, Makaha Surfside, Makaha Valley Plantation  were developed. The earliest residents of Makaha got on quite well. Everyone fishes there. Crops could be planted where they would grow good, coconuts near the beaches. They raised chickens, pigs, and dogs. Lush forests provided the wood they needed, and they had water for taro.  Makaha is a place where it is a hotel area for people that are attending the beach park  in the area.  Makaha does not have that many things there as locals say but it is overall a good place to vacation or chill at the beach.  The town is particularly known for its surfing waves and surfing history, the Hawaiian temple KaneAki Heiau, and Makaha Beach Park, which is a nesting place for several species of sea turtles. Aside from surfing, other water activities include diving, canoe-surfing, fishing, tandem surfing, bodysurfing, and other recreational water sports.KaneAki Heiau is Hawaii’s most thoroughly restored ancient heiau, it was excavated by Bishop Museum archaeologists in 1970 and can now be visited Tuesdays-Sundays. It originated as an agricultural temple to the god Lono in the 15th century. 200 years later, it was converted into a luakini, where human sacrifices were dedicated to the god Ku, a typical progression indicating Makaha now supported a large enough population to have its own chief.</p>

Campbell was an Irish carpenter who moved to Maui at the age of 24. He went on to make his fortune in the sugar industry, purchasing land on several of the Hawaiian islands and becoming one of Hawaii's most successful business tycoons. When Campbell died in 1900, his land holdings, valued at $3 million.  Ewa beach is a town located northwest of Oahu Ewa beach is home to the united states military where they are housed in that area.

This highway made a defining line that separated mililani town from mililani mauka. The mililani real estate was planned to be a higher end residence compared to other towns…….. Mililani Mauka is a planned community. The armies of Oahu also trained for war up here, preparing for the invasions from forces from the other Islands that would then land their warships on the shores. Those exercise on these lands would prove to be extremely valuable on at least one occasion. Its land used to be a barren red clay of the plantation fields. The vision for Mililani Mauka real estate was a higher end residence on average than Town, with a greater percentage of townhomes in Mauka. It would also be more of a bedroom community, with only a small shopping center here, which is Long’s. And now, it has been booming with new houses and more new homes coming. The first people that moved into Mauka was 1992 and they started building it in 1990. </p>

A Russian group arrived there in 1816, and the port was later occupied by the British in the 1843 and the French in 1849 but was returned to King Kamehameha III, who on August 31, 1850, officially declared Honolulu a city and the capital of his kingdom. In 1850 Kamehameha III declared that Honolulu would be the capital of Hawaii. In 1905 after the us had taken over Hawaii they named honolulu the Oahu county but just two years later it was changed to the city and county of honolulu.

Today, Kaneohe is mostly a residential community, with very little agriculture in. The only commercial crop of any consequence in the area is banana. The name of kaneohe comes from an ancient hawaiian story of a local lady calling her husband's cruelty to the sharp edge of bamboo when it is cut which lead to the name of bamboo man. It used to be an agriculture area. The leading crops of kaneohe started with taro and sweet potato then it became rice later becoming pineapples ending with bananas. Even though the land around kaneohe bay were being changed somehow the reef stayed resilient.  Kaneohe use to be an waste area where human waste was dumped into the ocean bay since that happened it  has sparked environmental problems in the bay which damaged coral reefs where organisms are living in.  Project Opihi is cleaning up the bay today to clean the coral reefs.  Also during the pearl harbor attack from Japan Kaneohe had an air base where the Japanese bombed.  In the pearl harbor stories Kaneohe Bay Marine Corps Base was where a marine named John Finn fought a brave battle against the Japanese planes bombing the area he suffered 20 wounds from fighting in the open.

Chinese immigrants were the ones coming to work on this part. After a while though the rice farming started to decline because the older laborers couldn’t tend to the rice paddies, in addition to that the local demand for rice had declined. Punalu'u, like the rest of Ko'olau Loa, is predominantly rural. Small clusters of rural housing and a few country stores dot the agricultural landscape along either side of Kamehameha Highway. While Punalu’u is an independent ahupuaʻa, the name “Punaluʻu” is often used to reference a larger area that includes the ahupuaʻa of Punaluʻu. The name in hawaiian means diving springs.

                        <p>Mililani is a 35 year old Town. Mililani sprouted up from a the red clay of plantation fields in central Oahu.  Mililani was founded and got it’s name from a house salesman named Callum Au when he started sellings houses in the area the community name got its name Mililani. Mililani was ground zero for one of the most momentous battles in Pre-Kamehameha Hawaii. In 1410 the Chiefs of Maui and the Big Island attacked Oahu, the armies finally fighting the decisive battle in Kipapa Gulch, which runs just below Mililani Town and Mililani Mauka. Mililani sits on former plantation fields owned by Castle & Cooke, which began planning for its development in the early 1960s under its Oceanic Properties subsidiary. Though the first Mililani Town homes were occupied in 1968, the plans for converting the whole district into a residential area started a decade before in 1958.In 1986, Mililani was named an All-America City. It is the only community in Hawaii ever to receive this distinction. </p>
